<h1>The Purpose of Keyboard</h1>
I often need to include Greek or Hebrew words or phrases in normal, English documents and it's often a pain to do so.  This can be done for free and relatively simply by installing additional Microsoft keyboards through the <strong>Region & language</strong> panel of Windows <strong>Settings</strong> (or, in older versions of Windows, through the <strong>Control Panel</strong>).  However, that's a little fiddly to set up and I find that the various keyboards sometimes spontaneously set themselves to one of the other languages.  It's also somewhat distracting to keep changing from English to Greek or Hebrew and back again.

So, I decided to create a simple way of adding Greek and Hebrew that I can embed in my documents.  (Note: my base language is English but - apart from this help file - it should work fine with any other language ... but it has only been tested with English.  In particular, I don't know how well it will work with other right-to-left languages or with variants of Chinese, Korean, etc.)
<h1>An Introduction to the Application</h1>

<p>I think it is reasonably self-explanatory, but here's a brief overview.
  
  When the program starts, by default it will take you to the Greek keyboard:  </p>
<p align="center"><img src="HelpFiles/001_Initial_View.jpg" alt="Initial view of the application" width="1171" height="596" /></p>
<p>Clicking on any of the main Greek characters using your mouse will add them to the text box (<strong>Entered Text</strong>) at the top of the window. You can add a breathing, accent, iota subscript or diaeresis <em>to the preceding character</em> by clicking on the relevant key <em>after</em> you have entered the character to which the sign will be attached .  (By &quot;preceding&quot; I mean the character to the <em>left</em> of the hair-line cursor.) Note that, if you are not sure which symbol is which (because some are very small), hover your mouse over a key and the hint will tell you what that key is. <strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I have not made any attempt to prevent unrealistic or illegal use of symbols, so it is down to you to add only those elements that are allowed by Greek rules. The only non-Greek keys that currently function are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Backspace</li>
  <li>Delete</li>
  <li>Enter</li>
  <li>The arrow cursor keys:
      <ul>
        <li>Start of text </li>
        <li>Up</li>
        <li>Start of line </li>
        <li>Left</li>
        <li>Right</li>
        <li>End of line </li>
        <li>Down</li>
        <li>End of text </li>
	  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Clicking either one of the&nbsp;<strong>Shift</strong>&nbsp;keys or the&nbsp;<strong>Caps</strong>&nbsp;key will take you to the Majiscules, as you would expect:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="HelpFiles/001c_Shifted_View.jpg" alt="Hebrew Accents" width="1171" height="596" /><br />
</div>
<p>The difference between these two keys is, as you would expect: pressing&nbsp;<strong>Shift</strong>&nbsp;will revert to the main keyboard, once you have clicked on an accent or other key;&nbsp;<strong>Caps</strong>, on the other hand, will remain in the shifted keyboard. Note that you will always know that you are in Caps Lock mode because the <strong>Caps</strong> light will be illuminated. Click again on the <strong>Caps</strong> key to return to the normal miniscules. </p>
<p>Selected the <strong>Hebrew</strong> tab will take you to the Hebrew keyboard:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="HelpFiles/002_Hebrew_Keyboard.JPG" alt="Hebrew Keyboard" width="1171" height="596" /></p>
<p>As before, clicking on any of the main Hebrew characters using your mouse will add them to the text box (<strong>Entered Text</strong>) at the top of the window.  The various vowels and key symbols ar found on the top row of keys (and the mappaq next the to Pe key): clicking these will add the relevant vowel or symbol to the preceding character.  (By &quot;preceding&quot; I mean the character to the <em>right</em> of the hair-line cursor.) <strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I have not made any attempt to prevent unrealistic or illegal use of vowels or symbols, so it is down to you to add only those elements that are allowed by Hebrew rules. </p>
<p>As with the Greek keyboard, clicking either one of the&nbsp;<strong>Shift</strong>&nbsp;keys or the&nbsp;<strong>Caps</strong>&nbsp;key will take you to an alternative Hebrew keyboard which is, effectively, dedicated to accents, points and Yiddish characters:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="HelpFiles/002b_Shifted_View.JPG" alt="Greek Shifted Keyboard" width="1171" height="596" /></p>
<p align="left">Most of these accents and additional symbols are only used in full-text work and will probably be little used by most people. </p>
<h1>Using your physical keyboard</h1>
<p>You may prefer to use your non-Greek/non-Hebrew, physical keyboard. If so, you can do this.</p>
<h3>Greek Characters using your Keyboard</h3>
<p>You can use the physical keyboard at any time. To tell you what physical key presses relate to what Greek character or symbol, click on the <strong>Physical Key Sequences</strong> tab in the <strong>Greek</strong> tab control panel. This will tell you the way the program responds to your key presses:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="HelpFiles/004_Greek_Physical_Input.JPG" alt="Physical Keyboard - Greek" width="1171" height="596" /> </p>
<p>Lower and upper case functions much as in English. So, &quot;e&quot; gives &epsilon; and &quot;E&quot; gives &Epsilon;. There are a few characters that vary from English and, in these cases, they are formed by holding down the Ctrl key while tapping the obvious key, as follows:</p>
<table align="center" width="900" border="1">
  <tr>
    <td width="256">Ctrl + ... </td>
    <td width="224">...</td>
    <td width="182">Ctrl + Shift + ... </td>
    <td width="210">...</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>e</td>
    <td>&eta;</td>
    <td>E</td>
    <td>&Eta;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>t</td>
    <td>&theta;</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>&Theta;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>s</td>
    <td>&sigmaf;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>p</td>
    <td>&psi;</td>
    <td>Y</td>
    <td>&Psi;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>o</td>
    <td>&omega;</td>
    <td>O</td>
    <td>&Omega;</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Note that we have also supplied w (=  &#989;) and W (= &#988;).</p>
<p>You can revert to the mouse-based keyboard at any time by cli8cking on the <strong>Virtual Keyboard</strong> tab. </p>
<h3>Hebrew Characters using your Keyboard </h3>
<p>First of all, select the <strong>Hebrew</strong> tab and then, as with Greek, click on the <strong>Physical Key Sequences</strong> tab. You will subsequently see the following:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="HelpFiles/003_Hebrew_Physical_Input.JPG" alt="Physical Input - Hebrew" width="1171" height="596" /></p>
<p>This may look a little complex at first but you will soon get used to it. The top table tells you which physical keys are translated as Hebrew characters. For example, typing &quot;m&quot; will enter the normal Hebrew character, Mem (<span class="style2">&#1502;</span>). Note that all characters that have a different terminal form can be entered as either lower case characters (for the non-terminal form) or upper case, for the terminal form. For example, typing &quot;M&quot; will enter the terminal Mem (<span class="style2">&#1501;</span>). In other cases, where we have two consonants with varying but similar pronunciation (such as he - &#1492; - and heth - &#1495;), the same English character will be used but one will be lower case and the other upper case. </p>
<p>The transliteration does <em>not</em> follow any standard protocol and the rationale for specific characters is as follows:</p>
<table width="670" border="1" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td width="122">Hebrew Character </td>
    <td width="137">Keyboard Equivalent</td>
    <td width="389">Rationale</td>

    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&#1495;</td>
    <td>H</td>
    <td>As explained above </td>
  </tr>

    <td>Following modern Hebrew pronunciation </td>

    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&#1498;</td>
    <td>K</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&#1502;</td>
    <td>m</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&#1501;</td>
    <td>M</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&#1504;</td>
    <td>n</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&#1503;</td>
    <td>N</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&#1505;</td>
    <td>s</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&#1513;</td>
    <td>S</td>
    <td>The sin or shin dot is added like a vowel, afterwards </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&#1510;</td>
    <td>c</td>
    <td>This was a bit of a compromise </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&#1509;</td>
    <td>C</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&#1497;</td>
    <td>y</td>
    <td>As you'd expect </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&#1506;</td>
    <td>Y</td>
    <td>Again, because it has a similar shape. (I toyed with an apostrophe or an exclamation mark but I decided this is simpler) </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&#1508;</td>
    <td>p</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&#1507;</td>
    <td>P</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>

<p>Vowels follow a similar rationale where I have tried to use lower case for short vowels and upper case for long vowels (where they are not represented by consonants). Note that the qamats is also used for the short o (although the qamats qatan <em>is</em> provided, as we will describe below).</p>
<p>The bottom table shows how you can add less used symbols - mainly accents. These are less intuitive and less easy to memorise. The first ten characters are found simply by using the numbers 0 to 9. The rest are a combination of the Ctrl key and a number or letter. There is no real rational in which physical key gives which character: they are simply in Unicode sequence.</p>
<p>In all cases, if you hover over   the Hebrew character, a small prompt will appear to tell you what it is. This is because some symbols are very small and difficult to see clearly. </p>
<h3>The Arrow Cursor Keys </h3>
<p>Note, in addition, that the arrow keys have been replaced by the four keyboard arrow keys. If used on their own, they will move you one character or line in the indicated direction. If you hold down the&nbsp;<strong>Ctrl</strong>&nbsp;key while tapping them, they will take you to the extreme in that direction. Clicking on the <strong>Show Keystrokes for Cursor movement</strong> button will open a small window that reminds you of what keystrokes provide cursor movement. This has been provided in a window that you can keep open and visible at all times, should you choose:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="HelpFiles/006 Arrow Cursor movements.JPG" alt="Arrow Cursor Movements" width="368" height="300" /> </p>
<h1>What do I do with it?</h1>
<p>When you have typed in your Greek or Hebrew content, simply:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click on the Copy button (to the right of the text box);</li>
  <li>Switch to your word processor (or whatever you are using);</li>
  <li>Make sure you have set your cursor to the position in the document where you want to add your Greek or Hebrew;</li>
  <li>Paste the text into your work.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can paste the text either by holding down the <strong>Ctrl</strong> (Control) key on your keyboard while you press the <strong>V</strong> key, or by right clicking with the mouse where you want to place the Greek or Hebrew and selecting <strong>Paste</strong> from the pop-up menu. Note, in Word, right click in the correct location and you will be presented with a pop-up menu:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="HelpFiles/Word options.JPG" alt="Word Options" width="386" height="265" border="1" /></p>
<p>Select  the <strong>Keep Text Only</strong> symbol (the clipboard with an &quot;A&quot; in front) and it will reformat the text into the font and size that you are using. Note that, if your current text does not support Unicode characters, you may end up with gibberish. Also, if you are using some other word processor, it's worth doing some research to find out whether it offers you a similar facility. </p>
<h1>Some Simple Preferences</h1>
<p>Clicking on the&nbsp;<strong>File</strong>&nbsp;menu option on the application's main menu, and then&nbsp;<strong>Preferences ...</strong>&nbsp;will display an additional dialog:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="HelpFiles/005_Preferences.JPG" alt="Preferences" width="508" height="307" /></p>
<p>The first section will allow you to configure whether the application starts in the Hebrew or Greek keyboard. To the right of this section is a combo box that will determine the size of font in the&nbsp;<strong>Entered Text</strong>&nbsp;edit box from startup. The third area allows you to specify where any snippets of text will be saved, when you select the <strong>Save</strong> option. </p>
<p>Note, also, that there is an option in the main menu to change font size. This will dynamically change the size of everything in the <strong>Entered Text</strong> edit box during your editing session but the application will <em>not</em> remember past or current sizes, other than that specified in<strong> Preferences</strong>.  </p>
<h1>Feedback</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table width="528" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="135">You can get in touch with me at: </td>
    <td width="377"><img src="HelpFiles/feedback.png" alt="Feedback" width="255" height="198" /></td>

    <h1>1. The Purpose of Keyboard</h1>
    <p>If you want to type Greek or Hebrew words or phrases, options are
      limited: you can</p>
    <ol>
      <li>do it for free and relatively simply by installing additional
        Microsoft keyboards through the <strong>Region &amp; language</strong>
        panel of Windows <strong>Settings</strong> (or, in older versions of
        Windows, through the <strong>Control Panel</strong>);</li>
      <li>use arcane key strokes to enter Unicode values directly; or</li>
      <li>find some bespoke keyboard software.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The problem with option 1 is that it's a little fiddly to set up and our
      experience is that the various keyboards sometimes spontaneously set
      themselves to one of the other languages. It's also somewhat distracting
      to keep changing from English to Greek or Hebrew and back again. Option 2.
      requires that you know the Unicode value for each character that you want
      to enter. </p>
    <p>Enter GkHebKeyboard. It provides a simple way of adding Greek and Hebrew
      that can used in any document or application.</p>
    <h1><a id="mozTocId266073" class="mozTocH1"></a>2. An Introduction to the
      Application</h1>
    <p>It is our hope that the application is reasonably self-explanatory, but
      here's a brief overview. When the program starts, by default it will take
      you to the Greek keyboard: </p>
    <p align="center"><img src="HelpFiles/001_Initial_View.jpg" alt="Initial view of the application"
        height="596" width="1171" /></p>
    <p>Clicking on any of the main Greek characters using your mouse will add
      them to the text box (<strong>Entered Text</strong>) at the top of the
      window. You can add a breathing, accent, iota subscript or diaeresis <em>to
        the preceding character</em> by clicking on the relevant key <em>after</em>
      you have entered the character to which the sign will be attached . (By
      "preceding" I mean the character to the <em>left</em> of the hair-line
      cursor.) Note that, if you are not sure which symbol is which (because
      some are very small), hover your mouse over a key and the hint will tell
      you what that key is. <strong>Disclaimer</strong>: The approach in
      GkHebKeyboard is simple and no attempt to prevent unrealistic or illegal
      use of symbols has been made, so it is down to you to add only those
      elements that are allowed by Greek rules. The only non-Greek keys that
      currently function are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Backspace</li>
      <li>Delete</li>
      <li>Enter</li>
      <li>The arrow cursor keys:
        <ul>
          <li>Start of text </li>
          <li>Up</li>
          <li>Start of line </li>
          <li>Left</li>
          <li>Right</li>
          <li>End of line </li>
          <li>Down</li>
          <li>End of text </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Clicking either one of the <strong>Shift</strong> keys or the <strong>Caps</strong> key
      will take you to the Majiscules, as you would expect:</p>
    <div align="center"><img src="HelpFiles/001c_Shifted_View.jpg" alt="Hebrew Accents"
        height="596" width="1171" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>The difference between these two keys is, as you would expect: pressing <strong>Shift</strong> will
      revert to the main keyboard, once you have clicked on an accent or other
      key; <strong>Caps</strong>, on the other hand, will remain in the shifted
      keyboard. Note that you will always know that you are in Caps Lock mode
      because the <strong>Caps</strong> light will be illuminated. Click again
      on the <strong>Caps</strong> key to return to the normal miniscules. </p>
    <p>Selected the <strong>Hebrew</strong> tab will take you to the Hebrew
      keyboard:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="HelpFiles/002_Hebrew_Keyboard.JPG" alt="Hebrew Keyboard"
        height="596" width="1171" /></p>
    <p>As before, clicking on any of the main Hebrew characters using your mouse
      will add them to the text box (<strong>Entered Text</strong>) at the top
      of the window. The various vowels and key symbols ar found on the top row
      of keys (and the mappaq next the to Pe key): clicking these will add the
      relevant vowel or symbol to the preceding character. (By "preceding" I
      mean the character to the <em>right</em> of the hair-line cursor.) <strong>Disclaimer</strong>:
      As with the Greek, no attempt to prevent unrealistic or illegal use of
      vowels or symbols has been made, so it is down to you to add only those
      elements that are allowed by Hebrew rules. </p>
    <p>Clicking either one of the <strong>Shift</strong> keys will take you to
      an alternative Hebrew keyboard which is, effectively, dedicated to
      accents, points and Yiddish characters:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="HelpFiles/002b_Shifted_View.JPG" alt="Greek Shifted Keyboard"
        height="596" width="1171" /></p>
    <p align="left">Note that the <strong>Caps</strong> key (i.e. Caps Lock)
      will <em>not</em> do anything. The logic here is that these symbols are
      normally of a nature where you will want to return to the unshifted
      characters once used and so locking in majiscule mode is really not
      needed. Most of these accents and additional symbols are only used in
      full-text work and will probably be little used by most people. </p>
    <h1><a id="mozTocId36409" class="mozTocH1"></a>3. Using your physical
      keyboard</h1>
    <p>You may prefer to use your non-Greek/non-Hebrew, physical keyboard. If
      so, you can do this.</p>
    <h3><a id="mozTocId489000" class="mozTocH3"></a>3.1 Greek Characters using
      your Keyboard</h3>
    <p>You can use the physical keyboard at any time. To tell you what physical
      key presses relate to what Greek character or symbol, click on the <strong>Physical
        Key Sequences</strong> tab in the <strong>Greek</strong> tab control
      panel. This will tell you the way the program responds to your key
      presses:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="HelpFiles/004_Greek_Physical_Input.JPG" alt="Physical Keyboard - Greek"
        height="596" width="1171" /> </p>
    <p>Lower and upper case functions much as in English. So, "e" gives &#949; and
      "E" gives &#917;. There are a few characters that vary from English and, in
      these cases, they are formed by holding down the Ctrl key while tapping
      the obvious key, as follows:</p>
    <table align="center" width="900" border="1">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td width="256">Ctrl + ... </td>
          <td width="224">...</td>
          <td width="182">Ctrl + Shift + ... </td>
          <td width="210">...</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>e</td>
          <td>&#951;</td>
          <td>E</td>
          <td>&#919;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>t</td>
          <td>&#952;</td>
          <td>T</td>
          <td>&#920;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>s</td>
          <td>&#962;</td>
          <td> </td>
          <td> </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>p</td>
          <td>&#968;</td>
          <td>Y</td>
          <td>&#936;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>o</td>
          <td>&#969;</td>
          <td>O</td>
          <td>&#937;</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Note that we have also supplied w (= &#989;) and W (= &#988;).</p>
    <p>You can revert to the mouse-based keyboard at any time by clicking on the
      <strong>Virtual Keyboard</strong> tab. </p>
    <p>Generally accepted transliterations have <em>not</em> been used because
      it was felt that these combinations were more natural when using a
      keyboard (and, if we are honest, suited programming constraints). </p>
    <h3><a id="mozTocId395853" class="mozTocH3"></a>3.2 Hebrew Characters using
      your Keyboard </h3>
    <p>First of all, select the <strong>Hebrew</strong> tab and then, as with
      Greek, click on the <strong>Physical Key Sequences</strong> tab. You will
      subsequently see the following:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="HelpFiles/003_Hebrew_Physical_Input.JPG" alt="Physical Input - Hebrew"
        height="596" width="1171" /></p>
    <p>This may look a little complex at first but you will soon get used to it.
      The top table tells you which physical keys are translated as Hebrew
      characters. For example, typing "m" will enter the normal Hebrew
      character, Mem (<span class="style2">&#1502;</span>). Note that all characters
      that have a different terminal form can be entered as either lower case
      characters (for the non-terminal form) or upper case, for the terminal
      form. For example, typing "M" will enter the terminal Mem (<span class="style2">&#1501;</span>).
      In other cases, where we have two consonants with varying but similar
      pronunciation (such as he - &#1492; - and heth - &#1495;), the same English character
      will be used but one will be lower case and the other upper case. </p>
    <p>As with the Greek, the transliteration does <em>not</em> follow any
      standard protocol and the rationale for specific characters is as follows:</p>
    <table align="center" width="670" border="1">

    </table>
    <p>Vowels follow a similar rationale: we have tried to use lower case for
      short vowels and upper case for long vowels (where they are not
      represented by consonants). Note that the qamats is also used for the
      short o (although the qamats qatan <em>is</em> provided, as we will
      describe below).</p>
    <p>The bottom table shows how you can add less used symbols - mainly
      accents. These are less intuitive and less easy to memorise. The first ten
      characters are found simply by using the numbers 0 to 9. The rest are a
      combination of the Ctrl key and a number or letter. There is no real
      rational in which physical key gives which character: they are simply in
      Unicode sequence.</p>
    <h3><a id="mozTocId1734" class="mozTocH3"></a>3.3 The Arrow Cursor Keys </h3>
    <p>Note, in addition, that the arrow keys have been replaced by the four
      keyboard arrow keys. If used on their own, they will move you one
      character or line in the indicated direction. If you hold down the <strong>Ctrl</strong> key
      while tapping them, they will take you to the extreme in that direction.
      Clicking on the <strong>Show Keystrokes for Cursor movement</strong>
      button will open a small window that reminds you of what keystrokes
      provide cursor movement. This has been provided in a window that you can
      keep open and visible at all times, should you choose:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="HelpFiles/006%20Arrow%20Cursor%20movements.JPG"
        alt="Arrow Cursor Movements" height="300" width="368" /> </p>
    <h1><a id="mozTocId483978" class="mozTocH1"></a>4. What do I do with it?</h1>
    <p>When you have typed in your Greek or Hebrew content, simply:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Click on the Copy button (to the right of the text box);</li>
      <li>Switch to your word processor (or whatever you are using);</li>
      <li>Make sure you have set your cursor to the position in the document
        where you want to add your Greek or Hebrew;</li>
      <li>Paste the text into your work.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You can paste the text either by holding down the <strong>Ctrl</strong>
      (Control) key on your keyboard while you press the <strong>V</strong>
      key, or by right clicking with the mouse where you want to place the Greek
      or Hebrew and selecting <strong>Paste</strong> from the pop-up menu.
      Note, in Word, right click in the correct location and you will be
      presented with a pop-up menu:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="HelpFiles/Word%20options.JPG" alt="Word Options"
        height="265" width="386" border="1" /></p>
    <p>Select the <strong>Keep Text Only</strong> symbol (the clipboard with an
      "A" in front) and it will reformat the text into the font and size that
      you are using. Note that, if your current text does not support Unicode
      characters, you may end up with gibberish. Also, if you are using some
      other word processor, it's worth doing some research to find out whether
      it offers you a similar facility. </p>
    <h1><a id="mozTocId276172" class="mozTocH1"></a>5. Some Simple Preferences</h1>
    <p>Clicking on the <strong>File</strong> menu option on the application's
      main menu, and then <strong>Preferences ...</strong> will display an
      additional dialog:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="HelpFiles/005_Preferences.JPG" alt="Preferences"
        height="307" width="508" /></p>
    <p>The first section will allow you to configure whether the application
      starts in the Hebrew or Greek keyboard. To the right of this section is a
      combo box that will determine the size of font in the <strong>Entered Text</strong> edit
      box from startup. The third area allows you to specify where any snippets
      of text will be saved, when you select the <strong>Save</strong> option.
    </p>
    <p>Note, also, that there is an option in the main menu to change font size.
      This will dynamically change the size of everything in the <strong>Entered
        Text</strong> edit box during your editing session but the application
      will <em>not</em> remember past or current sizes, other than that
      specified in<strong> Preferences</strong>. </p>
